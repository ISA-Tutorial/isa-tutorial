                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Agentic AI systems are changing how people seek and use information. Yet, the research community has not fully adapted. Methods for studying, building, and assessing such systems often remain static, missing the interactive, temporal, and evidence-driven dynamics that characterize real information seeking. This half-day tutorial equips the CHIIR community with a concise, practice-oriented methodology for <em>leveraging</em> and <em>evaluating</em> information-seeking agents. We define a shared vocabulary for agents and connect it to user-centered IR constructs; we show how to design agentic workflows that elicit effective evidence seeking under temporal change (planning, tool choice, grounding); and we introduce log-based rubrics that score correctness, evidence support, adequacy, and cost. Short case studies and optional demonstrations using open frameworks (for example, Perplexica, local LLMs via Ollama, and metasearch engines such as SearXNG) illustrate how these ideas map to real systems. Attendees receive reusable materials, including slides and selected supplemental resources (e.g., example traces and optional demo notebooks), suitable for research and teaching. The tutorial assumes familiarity with core IR concepts but does not require prior experience with agent frameworks.</p>
