Preetam Dammu is a Ph.D. candidate in Information Science at the University of Washington. He works at the intersection of Information Retrieval and Generative AI, studying how people and AI systems seek, verify, and use information in dynamic, open-world environments. His current research focuses on making information-seeking agents and retrieval-augmented systems more reliable, auditable, and safe, with an emphasis on evidence-grounded behavior, robustness to changing information, and careful evaluation in real-world settings. His work appears in venues including SIGIR, WSDM, EMNLP, IJCAI, and WebConf, and has also received broader media attention through MIT Technology Review. He brings experience from both academia and industry research, including roles at UW, Amazon Science, and AWS AI, and is an inventor on multiple U.S. patents.
